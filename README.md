# minesweeper-game

(If you use this code, please cite this repo and/or my page, thank you!)

This code was a project I did this past Summer for my final computer science project to demonstrate my coding progress. Feel free to give comments on any improvements I should make!

One issue with the code is class inheritance with all 3 mineboard sizes is not used, so there are different functions for each of the three classes (MineBoardEasy, MineBoardMedium, and MineBoardHard). If anyone has any comments on how to do improve the class inheritance aspect of the code, please feel free to let me know in the comments.
